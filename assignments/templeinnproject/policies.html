            <h2>Guest Policies</h2>
            <p>All guests are welcome at Temple Inn & Suites, whether they are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of
                Latter-day Saints or not, provided that they adhere to our policies in keeping with Church standards,
                such as the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Appropriate language: No use of profanity or vulgar language on hotel property.</li>
                <li>No smoking or drinking / possession of alcohol or illegal drugs on hotel property.</li>
                <li>Moderate dress: Dress code adheres to standards set for missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ
                    of Latter-day Saints, with some exception. Tattoos, multiple piercings, beards, and unusual hair
                    colors are permitted for guests. For more information please visit <a
                        href="https://missionary.lds.org/clothing/elder/guidelines?lang=eng">Missionary Style
                        Guidelines</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Due to our hotel policy, suites are available only to long-term temple workers and their
                families. Exceptions may be made in the case of large vacancies. However, note that temple workers
                and their families
                will take precedence over
                current reservations if the need arises. The hotel will do its best to accommadate and/or refund your
                deposit in such a circumstance. Please contact us for more
                information regarding suite vacancies.</p>
            <p>Temple Inn & Suites reserves the right to discontinue service to guests who do not follow the policies as
                outlined if the guest's behavior becomes a distraction to the overall message and mission of our hotel.
                Such guests understand that they will not receive a refund if removed from the premises for disruptive
                behavior.</p>
